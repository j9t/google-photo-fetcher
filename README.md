# google-photo-fetcher

A PHP script that retrieves and redirects to a given Google user’s <em>current</em> profile photo. (That is, the profile photo URL never needs updating.)

Details: For the moment, please see announcement and <a href="https://plus.google.com/+JensOMeiert/posts/1xzvr3Wp8KA">documentation on Google+ post</a>.

⚠ The script may be in need of TLC.
