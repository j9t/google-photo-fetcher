# Google Photo Fetcher

A PHP script that retrieves and redirects to a given Google userâ€™s *current* profile photo. (That is, the profile photo URL never needs updating which is normally the case.)

Details: For the moment, please see announcement and [documentation on Google+ post](https://plus.google.com/+JensOMeiert/posts/1xzvr3Wp8KA).

----

The script is currently unmaintained and needs TLC (as of January 17, 2018). [Contributions welcome.](https://github.com/j9t/google-photo-fetcher/issues/new)
