# Google Photo Fetcher

A PHP script that retrieved and redirected to a given Google userâ€™s *current* profile photo. (That is, the profile photo URL never needed updating which was normally the case.)

Details: It did suffice to refer to announcement and [documentation on a Google+ post](https://plus.google.com/+JensOMeiert/posts/1xzvr3Wp8KA).

----

The script is now obsolete.
