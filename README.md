# Google Photo Fetcher

A PHP script that retrieves and redirects to a given Google userâ€™s *current* profile photo. (That is, the profile photo URL never needs updating.)

Details: For the moment, please see announcement and [documentation on Google+ post][1].

----

The script is currently unmaintained and needs TLC (as of November 8, 2016). [Contributions welcome.][2]
